<h2 id="c1">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>This little manual of prayers herewith
offered to English speaking
Christians in their own language,
has long been one of the treasures of the
German people. With the exception of a
few prayers, as hereinafter noted, it was
originally written by one of God&rsquo;s noblemen,
by one who &ldquo;lived and moved and
had his being&rdquo; in the things of the Kingdom
of God. Dr. John Habermann
(known also as Avenarius, Latinized form
of Habermann) died 1590 as superintendent
at Zeitz, was a famous preacher and a
distinguished scholar of his day. He was
noted for his profound knowledge of oriental
languages especially of the Hebrew.
Still it is not this but the fact of his little
prayer book that has endeared him to his
fellow Christians. And this manual of
prayers is the mature product of an inner
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
life rich in the grace of God. On every
page it bears the stamp of one for whom
the communion with the eternal Father in
heaven through the faith in Jesus Christ,
the Savior, is a blessed reality. Nothing
more natural therefore also than that he
should &ldquo;live and move and have his being&rdquo;
in the language of the Word of God. And
this is quite apparent in his prayer language.
God&rsquo;s Word give him the terms to
express his thoughts. Especially the Psalter,
the prayer and hymn book of Israel,
proves a veritable thesaurus of prayer
terms and of these he makes a copious use.</p>
<p>The present little volume presents the
Englished edition of &ldquo;Wachet und Betet,&rdquo;
as issued by the Synod of Iowa and other
States. Owing to the exigencies of the
times, with the great world war raging in
all its fury, a special set of prayers for
times of war has been added by the translator,
in the hope that they will add to the
usefulness of the book. These are found on
<a href="#c8">pages 131-138</a>. The hymns as far as possible
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
are given in the form as found in
the new Common Service Book with Hymnal.
Many of them however are new
translations that here appear in print for
the first time. For these we are indebted especially
to Prof. Alfred Ramsey of the
Lutheran Theological Seminary, Maywood,
Chicago, and the Rev. H. Brueckner
of Iowa City, Iowa, a fact which is here
gratefully acknowledged.</p>
<p>The labor of clothing these little gems
of prayer into the language of the land has
been done as a labor of love, albeit the
stress of other work often precluded the
continued effort. The work was done a
bit at a time. This little volume is herewith
issued with the fervent hope and
prayer, that it may long continue on its
course of blessing, and lead many lives into
the closer communion with God, through
Jesus Christ. Soli Deo Gloria!</p>

<h3>EXHORTATION TO PRAYER</h3>
<p>Arise, dear soul, and carefully reflect
who He is with whom thou speakest and
before whom thou standest when thou
prayest. Behold, thou speakest with God,
thy Maker, and standest in the presence of
Him, the eternal Majesty, whom thousand
times thousand holy angels and arch-angels
attend. Therefore, O Christian, enter thou
into the closet of thy soul, and beware, lest
thou failest to put from thee all sluggishness
of heart, and liftest up to thy God a
countenance free from blame. Then wilt
thou delight in the Lord and have power
with Him, and prevail. Yea, thou wilt
conquer the unconquerable God and bear
away the blessing through Jesus Christ.
Amen.</p>

<p><b><i>Our Father, who art in heaven; Hallowed

in heaven; Give us this day our daily
bread; And forgive us our trespasses, as
we forgive those who trespass against us;
And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
us from evil; For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory, for ever
and ever. Amen.</i></b></p>

<h3>Prayer for Sunday Morning.</h3>
<p>Lord, our Heavenly Father, Eternal
God! Blessed be Thy divine power and
might; magnified Thy fathomless goodness
and mercy; praised Thine eternal wisdom
and truth. For Thou hast shielded me
with Thy hand against the perils of this
night, and hast suffered me to rest and
slumber in peace under the shadow of Thy
wings. Thou hast kept and safeguarded
me with a father&rsquo;s care against the Evil
One and all his wicked designs and purposes.
Therefore, I magnify Thy goodness
and the wonders which Thou doest for the
children of men. I will exalt Thee in the
congregation. Thy praise shall evermore
be in my mouth. My soul shall bless
Thee, O my Lord, all that is within me
shall bless Thy holy name, and nevermore
will I forget Thy benefits. May the praises
of my lips, which in singleness of heart
I bring before Thee at this early hour, be
acceptable in Thy sight. I call upon Thee
with all my heart to preserve me this day
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
against all danger of body and soul. May
Thy holy angels have charge over me and
keep me in all my ways. Encompass me
with Thy shield and lead me on the paths
of Thy commandments that, like the children
of light, I may be blameless in Thy
service, to Thy good pleasure. Stay the
Evil One and all wickedness of this world.
Restrain mine own flesh and blood that I be
not overcome by them. Lead me with Thy
Holy Spirit that I attempt, do, speak, or
think nothing except what is well-pleasing
in Thy sight and conducive to the glory
of Thy divine Majesty. Behold, O God, I
consecrate and dedicate myself entirely to
Thy holy will, with body and soul, all my
powers and abilities, inwardly and outwardly.
Make me a living sacrifice, holy
and acceptable unto Thee, so that I may
render Thee a reasonable and pleasing service.
Therefore, Most Holy Father, Almighty
God, let me be wholly Thine.
Govern Thou my heart and soul, and all
my emotions that I know and understand
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
none but Thee. O Lord, in the morning
wilt Thou hear my voice. Early will I
seek Thee and look up to Thee. Early will
I praise Thee, and will not cease when
evening comes. Through Jesus Christ.
Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Sunday Evening.</h3>
<p>Eternal God, Merciful Father, I lift up
my hands unto Thee as an evening sacrifice,
and render Thee most hearty thanks,
praise, and glory, that Thou hast protected
me this day and all the days of my life
from all evil and calamity, and through the
ministrations of Thy holy angels hast graciously
guarded me against the Evil One.
I pray Thee to forgive me all my sins,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
wherever I have done wrong. Surround
me this night with Thy holy angels. May
thou compass me round and cast a trench
about me, that I may escape the snares and
evil cunning of the enemy. I commend
myself to Thy goodness and mercy. Protect
me with Thine outstretched arm; for
from my heart do I pant after Thee in the
nightwatches, and with my spirit within me
do I watch for Thee at all times. I wait
upon Thy goodness, and my soul trusts in
Thee, the living God, for Thou art my
refuge and my Savior. Behold, O Lord,
whether we sleep or wake, we are Thine:
whether we live or die, Thou art our God
who hast called us into being. Therefore,
I cry unto Thee: let Thy grace be not
far from me. Shelter me with Thy shield.
Keep me, that I lie in quiet, sleep in peace,
and awake again in health. Hide me in
Thy pavilion in the time of trouble, in the
secret of Thy tabernacle hide me, set me
upon the rock, and I will fear no evil. Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for
Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me. Grant me grace, that
though my body sleep, my soul may ever
wake for Thee, that I may ever have Thee
in my heart and before my mind, and be
not overcome by the night of sin. Keep me
from all wicked and evil dreams, from restless
wakings and useless anxieties, from depraved
and hurtful thoughts, from all grief.
My Lord and God, into Thy gracious care
do I commend my body and soul, my brothers
and sisters, and all my kin and loved
ones. May it please Thee, O Lord, to save
us, and turn not Thy mercy from us. May
Thy grace and fidelity protect us alway.
Cover us this night with Thy goodness,
and encompass us with Thy mercy, that we
be safe-guarded in body and soul. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Monday Morning.</h3>
<p>O Thou Eternal and Merciful God!
Thou hast commanded Thy people in Thy
law each morning to offer Thee a burnt
offering, thereby to praise and thank Thee
for Thy merciful protection: thus I too
would bring unto Thee my offering of
praise, that is the fruit of my lips, and magnify
Thy holy name. For by Thy grace
and mercy Thou hast kept me this night
from all evil and harm in body and soul,
and hast graciously protected me. If Thou
hadst not been my shield and my help, manifold
calamities would have engulfed me,
and I could not have risen in health and
safety. Therefore, I thank Thee for Thy
protection. But I continue to call to Thee
from the depths of my heart, and my supplication
ascends to Thee in the early hour.
Early do I seek Thy countenance and pray
Thee to safeguard me and mine from the
wiles and power of the devil, from sin and
disgrace and all wickedness. Visit Thou
me in this early hour with Thy grace, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
without Thee I can do nothing, and grant
that I may this day begin all my work in
Thy name and end it joyously, to the glory
of Thy divine majesty and the betterment
of my neighbor. Preserve my soul, mind,
reason, senses, and thoughts, all that I do
and leave undone, that the prince of darkness
do me no injury. Safeguard me
against the destruction that wasteth at
noonday. Defend me against mine enemies
that neither secretly nor openly they harm
or injure me with their craft and cunning,
violence or malice. O God, Father and
Lord of my life, shield me from all impurity
and disorderly conduct. Keep me
from all intemperance and unchastity, and
turn from me shameless thoughts. Help
me by Thy grace to pluck out the eye that
offends me and cast it away, and renounce
all wicked and impure desires of the heart.
Grant whatever is pleasing to Thee and
useful to me, that I may serve Thee in the
true faith. Look upon me with the eyes of
Thy mercy, Thou Savior of the world, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
enlighten my heart and eyes, that I may
walk in the light of Thy grace, which rises
above me, and never lose Thee, the Eternal
Light. Amen.</p>

it to Thy mercy alone that Thou didst protect
me on all my paths. I pray Thee to
forgive me all my sins which I have committed
against Thee, and this night and
during our entire lives mercifully to defend
me and my loved ones against all sorrow
and anxiety, and against the craft and
power of the devil, wherewith day and
night he seeks to ensnare us. Preserve us
from the deadly pestilence that walketh in
the darkness, and deliver us from the snare
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of the enemy. Protect us from the temptation
and terror of Satan, from all evils of
body and soul. For Thou art our strong
fortress, our sword and buckler. All our
hope and trust rests in Thee. Therefore, O
faithful God, may Thine eyes be upon us
and we be safeguarded this night against all
violence and assault of the enemy. Be Thou
our keeper and protector. Encompass us
with Thy shelter, for in Thee is our salvation.
Unto Thee only, from whom cometh
my help, do I lift up mine eyes. My
help cometh from the Lord, who made
heaven and earth. Behold, as the eyes of
servants look unto the hands of their masters,
and as the eyes of a maiden unto the
hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon
the Lord our God, until that He have
mercy upon us. Have mercy upon us, O
Lord, have mercy, for we are poor and
needy. Lift upon me the light of Thy
countenance lest I sleep the sleep of death.
Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Tuesday Morning.</h3>
<p>Blessed be God, the maker of heaven
and earth, blessed be the Lord, who only
doeth wondrous things, and blessed be His
glorious name for ever who hath made both
day and night through His glorious wisdom,
and so ruled, that while the earth remaineth,
they shall not cease, that man may rest
by night, and proceed again to his labors
by day. O Lord, how manifold are Thy
works! In wisdom hast Thou made them
all: the earth is full of Thy riches. For
such Thy gifts we should thank Thee ere
the sun rises, and come into Thy presence
when the light breaks forth. Therefore I
bless Thee now also, for Thou hast suffered
me securely to rest and sleep this night, and
again awakened me to the joy of living.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Thou hast mercifully sheltered me from the
assaults and malice of enemies. I supplicate
Thy grace: grant that my soul may
repose in Thy hands, my body continue in
health according to Thy good pleasure, and
be kept from all injury and peril. Be Thou
my mighty protection and strong stay, a defence
from heat, and my cover from the
sun at noon, my preservation from stumbling,
and my help from falling, that no
harm may come unto me. O Merciful God,
knowing the hour is come to awaken out of
the sleep of sin and iniquity, for now is our
salvation so near, the night is far spent, the
day is at hand: so help us to cast off the
works of darkness, and put on the armour
of light, that we may walk honestly as in
the day; not in rioting and drunkenness,
not in chambering and wantonness, not in
strife and envying, but putting on the Lord
Jesus Christ in the true faith and a Christian
conduct. Thus awaken us each morning.
Open Thou my ears that I may hear
Thy holy Word with a believing heart and
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
keep the same in my memory. Let my ears
incline to the entreaties and prayers of the
needy, not to forsake them in their distress.
And when in my distress I cry unto Thee,
hear Thou the voice of my supplications,
and despise not my sighings in the hour of
death. Let my prayers come before Thee
early. Incline Thine ears to my entreaties.
Satisfy us early with Thy mercy; that we
may rejoice and be glad all our days. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Tuesday Evening.</h3>
<p>Lord, Merciful God, Holy Father, in
the daytime do I cry unto Thee with my
voice, in my distress I call upon Thee, and
at eventime I remember Thy goodness and
mercy, which Thou hast wrought for me.
And especially do I magnify Thee now,
that purely out of fatherly grace and mercy,
without any merit or worthiness on my
part, Thou hast this day preserved me from
all harm and danger and kept me from sudden
death. Therefore do I now and at all
times render unto Thee praise and thanksgiving,
and pray Thee, for the sake of the
bitter sufferings of Jesus Christ, to forgive
me wherever I have sinned against Thee
this day. Mercifully protect me during the
night against my adversary, the devil, and
against the fears and terrors of the night.
Suffer me to rest without anxieties and
worries, and may the eyes of my faith ever
behold the lustre of Thy countenance even
during the shades of night. For Thou art
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
that shining and true light, which dispels
all darkness that surrounds us. Thou, O
Lord, art ever with me. Thou art my rock,
and my fortress, my deliverer, my strength,
in whom I will trust, my buckler, the horn
of my salvation, and my high tower. Lord,
my God, at eventime do I lift up my hands
unto Thee. Come unto me as the latter
rains that make the earth fruitful. Abide
with us, for the day is far spent and in the
darkness there is none to defend us save
Thou alone, our God. Hasten to uphold
us. Defend us this night, lest our souls fall
into the sleep of sin and our bodies be overcome
with evil. Awake us again in due
time, and make us to hear joy and peace,
for we love Thy word and Thy testimonies,
which are the delight of our souls. May
our ears be saved from all messages of sorrow,
and all anguish be turned from our
souls; for Thou canst prosper all that liveth,
and fill my life with Thy blessing; in
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Wednesday Morning.</h3>
<p>Almighty, All-gracious God! All Thy
creatures should praise and glorify Thee.
The birds under the heavens magnify Thee
with lovely songs early in the morning as
their Lord and Maker. So will I too
heartily thank Thee, that Thou hast preserved
me under Thy shelter and protection
during the night now past, and all my
life even to the present hour, and awakening
me from the sleep of the darkness of
this night, hast suffered me to arise again
in health and joy. I pray Thee for the
sake of the saving resurrection of Jesus
Christ from the dead, that Thou wouldst
ever keep me together with all my loved
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
ones from all danger and evil. O Lord,
save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance:
feed them also, and lift them up for
ever. Fill me also at this early hour with
Thy grace, that I may pass this day rejoicing
in Thy commandments, and free
from mortal sin. Let me experience Thy
grace as a dew from the womb of the
morning, and as the refreshing moisture
that diffuses at the break of day, making
the land fruitful. Thou wouldest spread
Thy goodness over me, that I may gladly
and zealously do Thy will. Govern me
with Thy Holy Spirit that I may serve
Thee in righteousness and holiness of
truth, well pleasing in Thy sight. Guard
me that I sin not against Thee, nor defile
my conscience with carnal lusts that militate
against the soul. Keep my tongue from
evil, and my lips from speaking guile.
Foolish talking or jesting, unbecoming of
Christians, be ever far removed from me.
Grant, that I offend none with my lips,
nor backbite, judge nor condemn, defame
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
nor vilify. O that I might put a lock to
my lips and seal them with a strong seal,
that they bring me not to naught, nor my
tongue destroy me. Give me grace that I
may know my shortcomings and correct
them, and not fall into Thy righteous
judgment and condemnation. Grant my
prayer, O Eternal God, for the sake of
Thy dear Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Wednesday Evening.</h3>
<p>Most Holy Trinity, One in essence,
Three in person, who art my life, salvation,
and eternal joy, I praise and thank
Thee with mouth and heart that Thou hast
so graciously protected me throughout this
day. I pray Thy divine goodness to cover
up all my shortcomings, and especially
where this day, with my tongue, with vain
and unprofitable words, slander or otherwise,
I have sinned against Thee and Thy
holy commandments. According to Thy
name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
ends of the earth: Thy right hand is full
of righteousness. Therefore I commend
my body and my soul into Thy hands.
Thy divine Majesty bless me; Thy holy
Trinity shelter me; Thy eternal Unity preserve
me. May Thy unbounded mercy
protect me; Thy inexpressible benevolence
defend me, the sublime truth of God cover
me; profound knowledge of Christ
strengthen me; the unfathomable goodness
of the Lord keep me. The grace of the
Father govern me; the wisdom of the Son
refresh me; the power of the Holy Spirit
enlighten me. My Creator aid me, my Redeemer
quicken me, my Comforter abide
with me. The Lord bless me and keep me.
The Lord make His face shine upon me
and be gracious unto me. The Lord lift
up His countenance upon me and give me
peace. The protection and blessing of the
one and eternal Godhead be between me
and all mine enemies, visible and invisible,
today and always, that they may not approach
nor injure me. As the pillar of the

could not come together, and no harm befall

be a pillar of fire and a wall of separation
between me and mine enemies, that no
harm come over me. Keep me also in my
last hour. When mine eyes no longer see,
mine ears no longer hear, my tongue no
longer speak, be Thou with me, O blessed

<h3>Prayer for Thursday Morning.</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ, Thou art the eternal light,
which dispelleth the darkness of night and
the shadow of death: I magnify Thy
name, I glorify and thank Thee. For Thou
hast so graciously kept me during this
night, and hast brought me out of the darkness
to the light of day. Thou hast shielded
me against the terrors of the night, the
snares of the devil, the noisome pestilence,
that walketh in the darkness, manifold illness
and disease. Thou hast guarded and
watched over my soul, even as the shepherd
watches over his flock. And all that I possess
is kept from harm through Thy great
mercy. Praise and thanks be said unto
Thee for Thy gracious protection and all
Thy gifts. I will speak of Thy power and
magnify Thy goodness, when the day
breaks. For Thou art my refuge, my
strong tower, my present help, my faithful
God, in whom I trust. Thou makest glad
my heart and my countenance rejoiceth. I
pray Thee, for the sake of Thy holy birth
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and incarnation, suffer Thy grace to rise
in my heart and break forth even as the
beauty of the morning, and come over me
as the early rain. Illumine me with Thy
radiance, and be Thou the light of my
heart, for Thou art the right day star and
the true light, that lighteth men to the
eternal life. Be merciful unto me, O Lord,
for in Thee do I put my trust. My soul
waiteth for Thee, more than they that
watch for the morning, yea more than they
that watch for the morning. Be Thou
mine arm in the morning, my salvation also
in the time of trouble. Protect me in body
and soul, that no evil befall me and no
plague come nigh unto my dwelling. Keep
from me all wicked spirits. Defend me from
evildoers. Stand up for me against the
workers of iniquity and shield me, that the
hands of mine adversaries may not touch

<h3>Prayer for Thursday Evening.</h3>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O God, our Father,
through Jesus Christ in the Holy Ghost,
one, eternal God, who through Thy manifold
compassion hast kept me this day, a
poor sinner and miserable creature, from
the fiery darts of Satan that fly by day, from
the destruction that wasteth at noonday,
and hast graciously protected me from a
sudden and evil death. Thy mercy, O Lord,
is in the heavens; and Thy faithfulness
reacheth unto the clouds. Thou art gracious
and merciful, and all Thine acts are
glorious. I pray Thee, O merciful God,
graciously to forgive me all that I have
done against Thee this day, in thought,
word, or deed. Turn Thy mercy toward
me, that I may slumber and rest during
this coming night, and that I may never
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
turn from Thee, who art the eternal rest.
Suffer me ever to abide in Thee in the true
faith, and safely to sojourn under Thy protection,
so that the enemy may never come
nigh unto me, nor do me injury. Lord,
Thou art my light and my salvation; whom
shall I fear? Thou art the strength of
my life; of whom shall I be afraid? My
heart trusteth in Thee, and I am helped.
Thou art my strength and my great shield.
Thy right hand strengtheneth me. Thy
right hand gladdeneth my heart, and in
the shadow of Thy wings will I make my
refuge. Behold, my God, in the daytime
do I cry unto Thee, and Thou hearest me,
and in the night season I am not silent, and
Thou answereth my prayer. I remember
Thee on my bed, and meditate on Thee in
the night watches, because Thou hast been
my help. Therefore in the shadow of
Thy wings will I rejoice. My soul cleaves
unto Thee, for Thy right hand defends
me. When darkness comes over me, then
Thou, O Lord, art my light and my salvation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
O gracious God, vouchsafe unto me
Thy grace, so that when that last hour
cometh, and I lay me down on my deathbed
for the eternal rest, through Thy help,
in the true faith, in all confidence and trust,
I may happily fall asleep for the eternal
life. Meanwhile keep me in Thee, that I
may ever watch and pass my days in all
sobriety and moderation, and be found in
Christian readiness, since I can not know
the hour when Thou comest, O God, to
call me hence, so that I may be worthy to
stand before the Son of Man, and be not
put to shame; who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost, world
without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Friday Morning.</h3>
<p>Blessed be God, my Maker! Blessed be
God, my Savior! Blessed be God, my
Comforter! Who giveth unto me my
health, my life, and every blessing; my
very present help and my protection. Thou
hast kept me according to Thy great and
most blessed compassion during this night
now past against the onslaughts of Satan,
and preserved me in health. I beseech
Thee, Heavenly Father, through Jesus
Christ, Thy dear Son, take me this day also
into Thy divine protection, and shield me
that no evil may assail my life. For into
Thy hands do I this day and all days commend
my body and soul, my thoughts,
words, and deeds, all that I do or leave undone,
my going out and my coming in, my
walks and ways, my rising up and my lying
down, my will and counsel, my thoughts
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and desires, my faith and profession, the
end of my life, the day and hour of my
death, my passing away and my resurrection.
O Lord God, do Thou with me as
Thou wilt: for Thou knowest what serves
best Thy glory and my salvation. Keep
me in Thy fear and in the true knowledge
of Thee. Protect me from the deeds of
unrighteousness. And if perchance and by
reason of my frailty I sin against Thee, I
pray Thee take not from me Thy mercy;
turn not from me Thy grace; withdraw not
Thy help. For there is none other God
nor Helper but Thee, and as there is none
before Thee, there is none after Thee.
Thou art the first and the last, Alpha and
Omega, and there is none other God beside
Thee. Therefore do I call only upon
Thee: may Thy goodness rule over me.
Cause me to hear Thy loving kindness in
the morning; for in Thee do I trust. Lead
me on the paths of righteousness, that I
may not walk in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor stand in the way of sinners, nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
yet sit in the seat of the scornful, but that
my heart may ever delight in Thy word
and commandments, and meditate upon
them day and night; through Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Friday Evening.</h3>
<p>Blessed be the Lord God, who only
doeth wondrous things! And blessed be
His glorious name for ever: and let the
whole earth be filled with His glory! Daily
will I praise the Lord, and at eventime my
mouth shall thank Him while I have any
being. For when I cry with my voice, He
hears me, and gives ear to my supplication.
When I pray, He attends to my voice. The
Lord is my refuge and strength, a very
present help in trouble. Therefore do I
laud and magnify Thee, Eternal God, that
Thou hast this day so mercifully kept me
from every harm and evil. My heart is
glad and my soul glorifies Thee for Thy
goodness and mercy. Ever shall my tongue
speak of Thee and say, Blessed be the
Lord, and blessed be Thy holy name! I
pray Thee, graciously pardon, wherever I
have this day sinned against Thee, and
grant me and mine Thy protection during
the coming night. Be Thou my shield, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
my shade upon my right hand. O Lord,
preserve me from all evil, preserve my soul.
Be gracious unto me, for in Thee do I put
my trust. I trust in the Lord, and cry to
God, the Highest, to God Who endeth all
mine affliction. Behold, He that keepeth
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. He
will guide my steps on the paths of righteousness,
that I slip not and my feet do not
falter. He will not suffer my feet to be
moved, and His word is a light unto my
path. Therefore as I lay me down, I will
not be afraid of sudden terror, neither of
the desolation of wicked people, when it
cometh. For Thou keepest my foot from
being taken, and deliverest me from the
snares of death. O Lord God, lift upon
me the light of Thy countenance, that I
may lie down and sleep in peace, and dwell
in safety under Thy protection. For Thou
alone, O Lord, can help me. In Thy name
will I lie down to rest and let my eyelids
slumber. Thou, O Lord, wilt again awaken
me with rejoicing, to the glory and praise
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of Thine eternal majesty; through Jesus
Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Saturday Morning.</h3>
<p>O Thou Very and Eternal God, the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. To Thee
do I lift up my heart in dutiful gratitude.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
I will not hide Thy righteousness within
my heart. I will declare Thy salvation. I
will not conceal Thy loving kindness and
Thy truth from the great congregation, and
all the good that Thou hast shown me will
I not keep silent. For it is a good thing
to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
praises unto Thy name, O Most High: to
shew forth Thy loving kindness in the
morning, and Thy faithfulness every night.
Therefore my soul doth magnify Thee,
that Thou in Thy immeasurable grace hast
kept me during the night now past. Blessed
be Thou, Lord God Sabaoth, who art
merciful unto all, that seek Thee and love
Thy salvation. Blessed is Thy holy name
in all the earth, who art our refuge and
our help! Blessed are all Thy works
which Thou doest for the children of men!
I beseech Thee, protect me this day, that
the Evil One may not harm me, and the
hands of the wicked touch me not. Lord
God, my Savior, early will I seek Thee,
early do I cry unto Thee. Grant, that I
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
may fulfill the duties of my calling and
all that is committed unto me with diligence
and trust to the glory of Thy name
and the betterment of my fellowman, so
that I may not misuse the light of this day,
neither any of Thy creatures in the service
of sin and vanity, neither grieve Thee, nor
transgress the covenant of my Baptism with
anything I do or leave undone. Vouchsafe
unto me Thy grace, that I may guard myself
against the six things which Thou dost
hate, yea, seven which are an abomination
unto Thee: a proud look, a lying tongue,
and hands that shed innocent blood, a
heart that deviseth wicked imaginations,
feet that are swift in running to mischief,
a false witness that speaketh lies, and he
that soweth discord among brethren. From
such and the like vices preserve me, O God,
that I may nevermore be led nor consent
to them, but teach me to do Thy will; for
Thou art my God: Thy Spirit is good.
Lead me into the land of uprightness, that
I may serve Thee in a life that is without
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
blame, and my deeds and all my conduct
be pleasing in Thy sight; for Christ&rsquo;s
sake. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Saturday Evening.</h3>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, Thou great and
unchangeable God! Praise be unto Thy
goodness and mercy! Praise be unto Thy
eternal wisdom and truth, that Thou hast
preserved me during the day now past from
all danger and harm. I pray Thee, graciously
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
perfect Thy goodness which Thou
hast begun in me, and suffer me to rest this
night under Thy protecting shield, and
cover me with Thy wings. Suffer me to
put my trust under the shadow of Thy
hands, that I fear no evil. Keep me, O
God, as the apple of the eye. Hide me
under the shadow of Thy wings. Lord,
Thou art the portion of mine inheritance;
my salvation is in Thy hands. Grant unto
me, according to Thy goodness, that neither
fear nor trembling come over me, and no
terrors of the night overwhelm me. Be
merciful unto me, for in Thee do I put my
trust, and under the shadow of Thy wings
do I find my refuge. I seek the Lord in
the time of need; my hand is outstretched
in the night without ceasing; for my soul
has none other comfort; and I know of
none other helper in heaven or earth but
Thee alone. At midnight when I awaken,
I meditate upon Thy name, so altogether
lovely, upon Thy goodness and fidelity,
vouchsafed unto me, and I praise Thee because
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of Thy righteous judgments. When
I am troubled I remember God, when my
spirit is overwhelmed I speak of my Savior.
For He redeemeth my life from destruction
and saveth me from the snares of
death. Lord God, my Savior, by day and
by night do I cry unto Thee, pardon all
my transgressions, which during this day
and the week now past I have committed
against Thee. O Lord, deliver my soul for
Thy mercy&rsquo;s sake. Thou art gracious and
just, and our God is merciful. The Lord
preserveth the simple. I was brought low,
and He helped me. Therefore will I rejoice
and praise Thee, and sing aloud upon
my bed. For the days of my life will appear
as noonday, and darkness as the morning&rsquo;s
light, and I will rejoice that Thou,
O God, art my hope and my rest in life
and death. I lay me down, and none will
terrify me. Thus do I commend my body
and soul into Thy hands, Thou Faithful
God. Thou hast redeemed me through
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Daily Prayer.
<br /><span class="small">To be spoken mornings or evenings.</span></h3>
<p>Dear God and Lord! I live, yet know
not how long. I die, yet know not when.
Thou, O Heavenly Father, knowest. Lo,
dear Lord, is this hour, this day (this
night) the last of my life: Thy will be
done! Thou alone knowest best. As Thou
wilt I am willing through the true faith
in Jesus Christ, my Redeemer, to live or
die. But, O God, do Thou grant me this
petition, that I may not suddenly pass away
in my sins, and be lost. Vouchsafe unto me
true knowledge, repentance and sorrow over
my passed transgressions. Set them before
my sight in this life, that they may not at
the last day be set before me, and I be put
to shame before angels and men. Grant
me sufficient time and opportunity for repentance,
so that from all my heart I may
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
know and acknowledge my transgressions,
and from Thy saving word obtain forgiveness
and comfort for the same. O Merciful
Father, forsake me not, and take not
Thy Holy Spirit from me. My heart and
my heart&rsquo;s trust, O Thou Searcher of
hearts, is ever known to Thee. Keep me
in such trust to the life eternal. May I
die, when Thou wilt, only grant me a
peaceful and blessed End. Amen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord Jesus Christ, Thou highest good,</p>
<p class="t0">I pray Thee, through Thy precious blood,</p>
<p class="t0">Grant, that my final end be good. Amen.</p>
</div>

<div id="p16">
<h3>At the Beginning of the Week&rsquo;s Work.</h3>
<p>Rule Thou, O God the Father, who hast
made us, and like all other creatures ordained
us not to indolence but to work, and
bless each one in his calling. Thou who
rulest the universe also rule our own dear
government and graciously vouchsafe to it
Thy wisdom and strength.</p>
<p>Rule Thou, O God the Son, who hast
redeemed and ransomed us from sin. Take
from us the burden of sin committed during
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the week now past, and graciously
grant us Thy peace. Thou the Supreme
Bishop and Archshepherd of our souls, help
all servants of Thy word in this and all
Thy congregations on earth to labor and
bring forth much fruit unto eternal life.</p>
<p>Rule Thou, O God the Holy Ghost,
who hast sanctified us and born us again
in Holy Baptism. Create in us a clean
heart and renew a right spirit within us,
that we carry no evils of the past into the
new week, but put away all purpose and
inclination of the old Adam still in us.
Govern Thou our hearts with power; and
if this week mark for any of us the end
of life, help Thou in the last bitter hour.
Fill the heart with that grace which is
better than life. Teach the hands to battle
and vanquish the last enemy, and grant
for Christ&rsquo;s sake, the rest and triumph of
the sabbath everlasting.</p>
<p>Thou, the Triune and Immortal God,
be and abide with us and Thy Church forever.
Unto Thee be glory, laud, and
honor, world without end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of a Housefather.</h3>
<p>Gracious and Eternal God! Who Thyself
in Paradise hast ordained holy matrimony,
vouchsafe unto me Thy grace and
help in my married life, that I may ever
maintain the true Christian love and fidelity
toward my spouse. Grant, that I may
dwell with her, as with the weaker vessel,
in kindness and harmony according to
knowledge, giving honor unto her, as being
heirs together of the grace of life, and guide
her together with my children and servants
to the true knowledge of Thy divine glory,
and to modesty and honesty. Grant to
them also, O Lord, that they follow Thee,
and suffer themselves to be guided. Preserve
us, O Thou God of Peace, from strife
and dissensions, and the calumnies of the
enemy, from undue suspicion, which the
devil sows as a seed of perdition, and for
the destruction of conjugal love and faith.
Grant, that as Thy children we may suffer
and forgive each other in love and charity.
Give us faithful servants and keep
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
them in good health. Bless our labor and
all that contributes to the wants of the
body. Enable us to bear our cross with
patience, and grant that we be together
again in the after-life. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of a Housemother.</h3>
<p>O God Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Thou giver of all blessing and consolation,
behold me, whom Thou hast placed in the
estate of holy wedlock and made me the
mother of this family, with the eyes of
Thy mercy. Vouchsafe unto Thy handmaiden
Thy grace, that I may love Thee
above all things, seek Thee, and ever be
diligent in Thy service. And grant that
next to Thee I may honor, fear, and love
my husband, and obey him with patience
and kindness, in pure and modest conduct,
in piety and humility well pleasing to
Thee, and that the hidden life of my heart
be constantly adorned with a meek and
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
gentle disposition and every virtue, even as
in former times the consecrated women,
who trusted in God and continued in subjection
to their husbands. Enable me to
train my children and servants with meekness,
to the honor and glory of Thy holy
name. Give grace, that they follow me
with gentleness, and grant, that I with my
husband and family may satisfy the wants
of this life in good health and according to
Thy divine will. Protect us from harm
and from enemies. Enable us so to use this
world that we be not hindered in our salvation,
but in all things seek Thee, O Lord,
and endeavor to be well-favored in Thy
sight. May we not despise the cross neither
murmur against it, but bear it in patience,
and thus remain in Thy keeping unto the
end. May we as servants of God bring
forth abundant fruitage, live holy lives in
this world, and attain to the everlasting
inheritance in the world to come. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of a Child.</h3>
<p>Almighty and Eternal God! Thou hast
commanded me to honor my parents, and
in all things, which are not contrary to
Thy word, to obey them. I beseech Thee,
for the sake of the obedience of Thy dear
Son, Jesus Christ, my Lord, grant unto
me, that I may duly honor my father and
mother, serve them, obey, love, and esteem
them, so that their blessing may dwell with
me to the end of my days. Keep me from
sin and evil communications, that I may not
anger or grieve my dear parents with
hatred, sadness, scornfulness, disobedience,
or obstinacy, and thus bring upon myself
on this earth already their and Thy curse,
and in the after-life Thy eternal wrath.
And since I have sinned many times
through weakness, I beseech Thee, work in
me sorrow and true repentance, through
Jesus Christ, my Savior, who gave to me
the example of true obedience. Grant,
that according to His example I may ever
grow, and increase in wisdom, stature, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
grace before Thee, O God, and all men.

<h3>Prayer of a Youth or a Maiden.</h3>
<p>Lord, Almighty and Holy God, who
lovest a pure heart, a chaste mind, and a
holy life: I pray Thee, create in me also
a clean heart, and renew a right spirit
within me, so that I may serve Thee with
sincere faith and true fear, and love Thee
with all my strength. And keep me from
all impure communications. Subdue the
evil lusts in my heart, and extinguish the
fires of fleshly desire. Preserve me from
unchaste and dissolute associations, from
rioting and drunkenness, which lead to excess.
May all filthiness, and foolish talking,
unbecoming a Christian, be ever foreign
to my life. Keep me from arrogant
pomp, or idleness and lounging, from the
snares and nets of the devil. Grant, that
I may serve Thee with a pure soul and
an undefiled body in true faith, as did pious
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and chaste Joseph in Egypt, and graciously
take me into Thy safekeeping against all
temptations and seductions of life, for the
sake of Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of a Servant.</h3>
<p>Merciful God, Who through the precious
suffering and death of Thy dear Son,
Jesus Christ, hast redeemed and made me
free from eternal servitude, from the power
of sin, from the dominion of darkness, from
the cruel tyranny of the devil, and the mastery
of death and hell: I beseech Thee,
grant me grace, so that in my present station
and calling, in which Thou hast placed
me on earth according to Thy good pleasure,
I may not be dissatisfied, nor murmur
impatiently against Thy ordinance, nor yet
envy others in their more exalted stations,
but help me to do such Thy will from the
heart, with good will, ever thinking that I
serve Thee, O God in Heaven, and not
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
men. Help Thou, dear Father, that I serve
Thee, the supreme Lord of heaven and
earth, in true knowledge and upright fear,
love Thee above all things, put all my hope
and salvation in Thee, and continue in Thy
commandments without blame. May I also
be subject to my masters and mistresses according
to the flesh, not only to the good and
gentle, but also to the froward, and patiently
obey them in everything that is not contrary
to Thy pleasure, with fear and singleness
of heart, as unto Christ my Lord, not
with eye-service, as man pleaser, but from
the depths of my heart and for the sake of
Thy will and commandment. Grant me
grace that I may be found faithful in all
things committed and entrusted to my care,
not neglect nor bring them to naught, suffer
no harm to come through carelessness on
my part; also that I may not covet nor
fraudulently appropriate to my own use the
possessions of another entrusted to my care.
Preserve my health, strengthen my limbs
and all the powers of my body. Endow
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
me with wisdom and understanding, that I
may perform the labor of my masters and
mistresses, with Thy help improve their living.
May they be blessed through my industry;
and all that I do and perform, may
it redound to Thy divine glory and a blessed
exercise of my faith. For Christ, Thy dear
Son&rsquo;s sake, who liveth and reigneth with
Thee and the Holy Ghost, world without
end. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of a School Child for the Holy Spirit.</h3>
<p>O my dear Lord, Jesus Christ, I thank
Thee, that to the present day, Thou ordainest
church and school ordinances and regulations,
and hast given unto my parents
and me grace, that I too may be thus
trained. I beseech Thee, fill me with Thy
Holy Spirit, that I may ever obey my dear
parents and teachers, who only seek my
welfare. Give unto me a docile heart, that
I may learn my catechism, noble arts and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
language, and thus increase in godliness,
wisdom, understanding, and every virtue.
O my dear Lord Jesus Christ, create in me
a pure, chaste, and modest heart. May I
ever serve Thee in upright faith and true
fear, and love Thee from all my heart.
Subdue in me all evil lusts. Endow me
with Thy Holy Spirit. Help me to continue
in true humility. Grant me an obedient
heart, to honor my parents according
to Thy commandment, and neither anger
nor grieve them. May they live long on
this earth, and protect Thou and preserve
them from disease, evil, and harm. Be
gracious unto us and merciful. Bless us in
body and soul, now and forevermore.
Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer During a Thunder Storm.</h3>
<p>Most Mighty God! All the powers of
the earth shall honor Thy holy name, and
worship Thee, Eternal Father, in the beauty
of holiness. For Thou art the Lord,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
who reigneth over all. Thou showest Thy
might and power throughout the universe.
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters.
The Lord of glory thundereth. The Lord
is upon many waters. The voice of the
Lord is powerful and full of majesty. The
earth shook and trembled. The foundations
also of the hills moved and were
shaken. There went up smoke out of Thy
nostrils, and fire out of Thy mouth devoured:
coals are kindled by it. Thy pavilion
round about Thee are dark waters
and thick clouds of the skies. The Lord
thundereth in the heavens, and the Highest
gave His voice. All things are subject to
Thee. All things acknowledge Thee as
their maker, and tremble before Thy divine
majesty. The mountains and the depths of
the abyss are sore vexed when Thou art
wroth, the earth trembleth, and the sea
and the waters flee because of Thy wrath.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames
of fire. The voice of the Lord shaketh the
wilderness. The Lord is king forever. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Lord will give strength unto His people.
The Lord will bless His people with peace.
O merciful God, preserve us from Thy
wrath, which is beyond endurance! Forgive
us our sins! Make Thy face shine
upon us! Cause this grievous tempest to
pass by without harm to us! Protect us in
body and soul, our house and home. Keep
the fruits of the fields from hail and storm,
from great inundation by water and all
harm. O Holy God, preserve us from an
evil death, and protect us, that no disaster
befall us. Amen.</p>

<h3>Thanksgiving After a Thunderstorm.</h3>
<p>Almighty God, our Heavenly Father,
who has said, Call upon Me in the day of
trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify Me; we praise and thank Thee
most heartily. For Thou hast graciously
heard our prayer and hast made this storm
to pass that no harm befell us in life and
property. Thus hast Thou again revealed
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to us Thy fatherly compassion, and that
Thou wouldest not deal with us after our
sins, neither reward us according to our iniquities.
Grant us, O Merciful Father, for
the sake of Thy only begotten Son, Jesus
Christ, that we may take heed of Thy
earnest and fatherly admonitions, improve
our lives, and live in the fear of Thee.
May we constantly prepare and make ready
ourselves for the coming of Thy dear Son,
when the elements shall melt with fervent
heat, and the earth also, and the works
thereof, shall be burned up, and may we
meet Him with rejoicing and enter the new
heaven, wherein dwelleth righteousness, and
forever be with Thee; through the same,
Thy dear Son, our Master and Redeemer,
Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer on the Eve of a Journey.</h3>
<p>Almighty and Gracious God and Father,
Thou protector of all that trust in Thee
from their hearts! In Thy name will I
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>

Thou art my God and preservest my going

feet in right paths and wilt not suffer them

be my gracious guide and companion on
this present journey. Send Thy holy angels,
and command them, in all my wanderings,
to keep me from all evil in body and soul.
Lead me on the paths of the righteous and
bring me safely to my destination, that I
may laud and magnify Thee, here in time

Thou didst lead Thy servant Abraham
from the land of the Chaldees and kept him
unharmed in his pilgrimage, and didst say
to his grandson Jacob when he journeyed
to Mesopotamia, I am with thee, and will
bring thee again into this land; and as
Thou also didst lead the Children of Israel
through the Red Sea and through the desert,
and didst go before them, by day in a
pillar of a cloud and night in a pillar of
fire: thus wouldst Thou also be with me
on my wandering, protect me on land and
sea, by day and by night, and keep me from
all harm and danger. And when my business
is completed bring me home again in
full health of body and soul. And as
Thou didst accompany youthful Tobias
through Thy angel Raphael, likewise do
Thou accompany me in all my ways, so that
when I, too, have happily returned to my
home, I with all mine own may have the
greater reason to laud and praise Thee as
my true and faithful guide. Meanwhile I

dear angels Thou hast again brought me to
my home, guarded and kept me from all
evil, preserved me from the murderous and
robbing hands of evildoers, and the teeth
of wild beasts, and kept me from all other
dangers of body and soul. In short, that I
have been led to and fro in health and happiness:
I owe it altogether to Thy fatherly
goodness and almighty care. And I beseech
Thee from all my heart, continue to
keep me and mine under Thy protection,
and preserve us, body and soul, to the eternal
life, for Jesus&rsquo; sake. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Birthday Prayer.</h3>
<p>Dear Father in heaven, I thank Thee
from all my heart, that Thou hast put me
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
into this world and made me a rational being.
I am born of Christian parents and
made a member of Thy holy Church. Today
the anniversary of my birth hath come,
and since I have been permitted to reach
this day and thus complete another year of
my pilgrimage, I thank Thee from all my
heart and joyfully reiterate the thanksgiving
of Thy servant David, &ldquo;Bless the Lord,
O my soul, and all that is within me bless
His holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul,
and forget not all His benefits: who forgiveth
all thine iniquities; who healeth all
thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from
destruction; who crowneth thee with loving
kindness and tender mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since every day of my life, however, is
one step nearer to death, which can strike
me this hour, yes, this very minute, I beseech
Thee so to shape and rule every day
of my life, that I may walk according to
Thy pleasure as in the day, that is circumspectly
in Thy sight, honestly, and conscious
of my responsibility, in short as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
true Christian and in conformity with the
promise made by me to Thee, my dear God,
in my baptism. And if this prove my last
year and my last birthday, I place all things
into Thy gracious keeping. If it is Thy
will that I should cease to live, then I have
lived enough. For if it is sufficient for
Thee, it is sufficient for me. Am I old
enough for Thee, I am old enough for me.
Here I again put myself under Thy shield
and protection, into Thy sublime and eternal
power. If I live this year, may I live
in Thee; if I die, may I die in Thee, so that
I may live, and move, and have my being
in Thee, and whether living or dying I may
be Thine to all eternity. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Temporal Peace.</h3>
<p>Eternal God, Everlasting Father! Thou
art a God and lover of peace. From Thee
all true unity cometh. We pray Thee
graciously to protect Thy Christendom on
earth against all its enemies, so that we may
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
be kept in peace, and ever serve Thee gladly
in faithful doctrine and a pure conduct.
Grant us grace, so that all estates and
rulers of Christendom may live peacefully
and harmoniously in perfect piety and godliness,
so that discipline and order prevail,
churches and schools be not destroyed, and
the country be not devastated nor grievously
oppressed. Grant us grace, so that men
will content themselves with what they
have, and will not for the sake of avarice or
lusting after foreign lands and peoples, nor
yet because of pride, vain ambitions, and arrogance,
enmity, hatred, envy, nor any other
cause, incite war, sedition, or revolution in
this our country. Hinder all evil counsel
and purpose of unstable men, who think
only of that which is not good. Put them
to naught in their purposes, so that they
must retreat and are utterly consumed with
terrors. Stretch forth Thine arm to protect
us who are named after Thee, so that
Thy heritage be not destroyed. Support
Thy faithful who rely upon Thee and call
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
upon Thy name. Hear us in our distress,
and Thy holy name protect us. Send us
help from Thy sanctuary, and strengthen
us from on high. Bless the country and the
cities in which Thy holy word dwelleth.
Prosperity must dwell within their palaces!
O merciful God, incline the hearts
of all men to a Christian peace and concord,
to the which Thou hast called us
through Thy word and gospel. And if
bitterness prevail among some, help that it
be done away with, to the glory of Thy
holy name, the spreading of Thy word, and
the betterment of Christendom, and that
the poor and distressed in the land may rejoice
in Thee and praise Thy holy name, for
Thou only performest wonders and provest
Thy powers among the nations. Amen.</p>
</div>
<div id="p33">
<h3>A Prayer for School.</h3>
<p>We pray Thee, everlasting God, Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, Thou eternal and
inseparable Trinity and inexpressible Unity,
that Thou wouldest faithfully take under
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Thy protecting wing the flock of Thy
Christendom, and ever abide in our midst
with Thy grace and truth. Be Thou with
us, O Lord, our God. Be Thou a wall of
fire round about us, and destroy them who
hate Thee and are hostile to Thy name.
So rule us, O God, that we may ever be
guided by Thy clear and pure word and
are not seduced by the external appearance
of things. Keep us, Lord Jesus, from error
and false doctrine, and send us faithful
teachers who take heed unto Thy congregation,
purchased with Thy blood, and are
anxious to perform Thy will. Grant us
obedient hearts, so that we, as lambs of Thy
flock, may obey Thy voice, and be filled
with fruits of righteousness. Teach us ever
to do Thy will, for Thou art our God:
Thy spirit is good. Lead us into the land
of uprightness, to the end that we, too,
through a blessed departure from this life
may attain to Thee and the everlasting joy
and blessedness, and behold Thy glory to
all eternity. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer When Going to Church.</h3>
<p>Almighty God, Heavenly Father, because
of Thy great mercy I will go to Thy house
and worship Thee in Thy temple in Thy
fear. Lord, lead me in the paths of righteousness,
and make Thy way straight before
my face. Guide me on the paths of
Thy commandments, for Thou art my
God, and the Lord of my salvation. I delight
in Thy sanctuary and rejoice in the
congregation of Thy saints, who confess
and glorify Thee. How amiable are Thy
tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul
longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of
the Lord. O come, let us worship and
bow down: let us kneel before the Lord
our maker. For He is our God; and we
are the people of His pasture, and the sheep
of His hand. Magnify the Lord our God,
adore at His footstool; for He is holy. I
worship Thee, O God, in the accepted
time through Thy great mercy. Hear me
according to Thy grace. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Sincere Repentance.</h3>
<p>Merciful and Gracious God, Thou art
slow to anger and plenteous in mercy!
Thou callest us daily through the gracious
preaching of Thy word to devout conversion,
and in Thy name causest repentance
and remission of sins to be preached. And
Thou showest Thy forbearance with us
through Thy long suffering and inexpressible
mercy, and dost not suddenly come
upon sinners in the midst of their evil deeds
with Thy righteous wrath and judgment
to punish them, but giveth place and time
for repentance, so that no one can justly
charge or accuse Thee. For Thou art not
willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance and have everlasting
life. O dear God, Thou knowest
the sluggishness of our flesh and the hardness
of our hearts, that we through inherited
sin are thus far deranged and so deeply
sunk in sin, that of our own accord we
can not rise or return. Therefore, for the
sake of the wounds of Jesus Christ, my
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Lord, I beseech Thee, convert Thou me,
and I am converted. For Thou art my
God, and where I am converted I will
truly repent. Save Thou me, O Lord, and
I am saved. Help me, and I am helped.
Behold, I am like an erring and lost
sheep. Seek Thou Thy servant, that I forget
not Thy commandments. Circumcise
the foreskin of my heart. Purge me, and
I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow. Create in me a clean
heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me. Cast me not away from Thy
presence; and take not Thy Holy Spirit
from me. O dear God, look upon me, as
Thou didst look upon Mary Magdalene,
the repentant sinner, as she lay at Thy feet
and wept over her transgressions; and the
publican in the temple, as he smote his
breast and besought Thy grace. Vouchsafe
unto me sincere sorrow and contrition
over my sin, and a true faith with firm
confidence in Thy grace, and also worthy
fruits of repentance. Let me discern the
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
day of Thy visitation, and not despise the
riches of Thy mercy, so that I may not neglect
the accepted time, and the day of Thy
salvation, and not fail to turn to Thee,
my Lord and God. May I not postpone
my repentance from one day to another,
nor yet to the last hour, but rather turn
to Thee this day and repent. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for the Forgiveness of Sins.</h3>
<p>Merciful Father, Eternal God, my sins
are grievous, many and great my transgressions,
and mine iniquities are innumerable,
for the imaginations of my heart are evil
from my youth. O Lord, who can understand
his errors? Behold, I acknowledge
my transgressions: my sin is ever before
me. Against Thee only have I sinned, and
done evil in Thy sight: that Thou mightest
be justified when Thou speakest, and be
clear when Thou judgest. I beseech Thine
infinite mercy, enter not into judgment with
Thy servant: for in Thy sight shall no
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
living man be justified. If Thou, Lord,
shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who
shall stand? Behold, if Thou contendest
with man, he can not answer Thee one of
a thousand, for all our righteousness before
Thee is as the filthy rag. Have mercy upon
me, O God, according to Thy loving
kindness: according to the multitude of
Thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from mine
iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin for
Thy name&rsquo;s sake. Lord, have mercy upon
me, save my soul, for, alas! I have sinned
against Thee. Remember, O Lord, Thy
tender mercies and Thy loving kindnesses;
for they have been ever as of old. Remember
not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
according to Thy mercy remember
Thou me for Thy goodness&rsquo; sake,
O Lord. Remember that we are flesh, as
the wind which bloweth and doth not return,
and cease in Thy anger and wrath
against us. O merciful God, I acknowledge
that my virtues and my deeds can
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
never blot out my sins, nor yet merit Thy
grace. Only the innocent suffering and
death of Jesus Christ, the Lamb without
spot or blemish, is the true offering for our
iniquities, and His blood, shed for the remission
of our sins, is the cleansing and
purification of our souls. In such confidence
and hope I supplicate Thee: forgive
Thou the transgressions of Thy people.
Cover our sins. Impute not our iniquities,
for Thou art merciful. Cleanse Thou me
from secret fault. Let my sorrowing soul
and my vexed bones again rejoice, for with
Thee there is mercy and plenteous redemption.
O Lord, hear the voice of my supplication,
and despise not the groanings of
my heart, for Christ&rsquo;s sake. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for True Faith.</h3>
<p>Lord, Almighty God, Thou Father of
lights, with whom there is no variableness,
neither shadow of turning, from whom every
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
good and perfect gift cometh, I pray
Thee, since all men have not faith: implant
and maintain in my heart through
the workings of Thy Holy Spirit the true
knowledge of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ,
and increase it from day to day, so that I,
too, may be filled with the knowledge of
Thy will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
that I may walk worthy of Thee
unto all pleasing, being faithful in every
good work, and increase in such knowledge
according to Thy glorious power in all patience
and long suffering with joy. Grant
unto me, according to the riches of Thy
glory, that I may be strengthened with
might by Thy Spirit in the inner man, that
Christ may dwell in my heart by faith. O
dear God, since no man knoweth the Son
but Thou, O Father, and no man knoweth
Thee, the Father, but only the same Thy
Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal
Thee, I pray Thee, draw Thou me unto
Thee. Grant me the knowledge of salvation,
which is the forgiveness of sins.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Strengthen my weak faith, which is small
as the mustard seed, so that it may increase,
and I be rooted and grounded in
Thee, and may stand steadfast and unmoveable.
Gracious God, Thou hast
kindled the spark of faith in my heart and
has begun this good work in me, I cry to
Thee, perfect it until the end, that we may
ever increase in knowledge and understanding,
and be sincere and without offense till
the day of Christ, being filled with the
fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
Preserve what Thou hast begun, that we
might war a good warfare, holding faith
and a good conscience, and not waver or
succumb in trial and temptation and make
shipwreck concerning faith. Therefore protect
me, my God, that I am not led astray
among the errors, schisms, and heresies of
the world. Preserve me from superstitions
and all false doctrine, that I may neither
err nor doubt in any article of faith. And
vouchsafe unto me Thy grace, that my faith
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
be not lifeless, inactive, or without good
fruits, but active and energetic, serving in
love, so that I, too, may carry off the end
of faith, which is the soul&rsquo;s salvation. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer Before Confession.</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Thou my Redeemer,
Thou hast given unto Thy dear Church on
earth and its faithful servants the sacred
office of the keys, and invested it with the
promise, that whatsoever by virtue of the
same they shall loose or bind on earth shall
also be loosed or bound in heaven: I thank
Thee, and eternally praise and glorify
Thee, for such Thy gracious gift. And,
since I a poor and bound sinner need this
blessed key which looseth, so that I may not
be kept under the bonds of the infernal
jailer, I beseech Thine infinite mercy, that
I may receive its comfort through my spiritual
father, my pastor, and for the sake of
Thy holy, precious blood and Thy innocent
offering and death be loosed from all my
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
sins. Grant me Thy Holy Spirit, so that
I may grasp this holy absolution in heartfelt
contrition and undoubting trust, firm
resolve, brotherly love and gratitude, and
inherit the eternal life. Amen.</p>

<h3>Thanksgiving After Absolution.</h3>
<p>O Blessed, Merciful, and Gracious God!
I thank and praise Thee from all my heart,
that through Thy servant Thou hast again
forgiven me, a poor sinner, all my sins,
again received me in grace, and promised
me eternal life. I earnestly pray Thee,
vouchsafe unto me Thy Holy Spirit, and
create in me a pure heart, so that I may
joyously trust that all my sins are forgiven
me through Jesus Christ. As an earnest
and surety of this blessed fact, I will now
eat and drink the true body and blood of
Thy dear Son Jesus Christ, under the bread
and wine, to my soul&rsquo;s salvation. Grant
me also, O faithful God, that henceforth
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
I may earnestly avoid all sin and better my
life. This Thou wouldest graciously grant
me for Thy name&rsquo;s sake. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Morning Prayer for Communion Day.</h3>
<p>Arise, my soul, this is the day which the
Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be
glad in it. Give thanks unto the gracious
and merciful God for His blessings and
say:</p>
<p>Almighty and Merciful God and Father,
I thank Thee from all my heart for the
protection of this night, for the refreshing
rest, and for the joyous morning, which
Thou hast granted unto me. I praise Thee
with all my soul for Thy wonderful mercy
which blesses me with the forgiveness of
my sins. Praised be Thy grace, which is
new each morn, and which on this day also
bids me to Thy house, and calls and invites
me to Thy altar.</p>
<p>O Lord, since I, too, would come to Thy
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Supper with the throngs which celebrate,
do Thou Thyself make me ready. As Thou
wouldest find a pure residence in me, do
Thou cleanse and consecrate my body and
soul. Guide me with Thine eye, and lead
me with Thy hand to the riches of Thy
mercy. Comfort me with Thy countenance,
and do not forsake me. As the hart
panteth after the water brooks, so panteth
my soul after Thee, O God.</p>
<p>And, that my sacred resolve may not be
hampered, I commend to Thee my body
and soul, reason, senses, and thoughts, whatever
I do or leave undone, my coming in
and going out, my walking, standing, sitting,
and resting, my imaginations and aspirations,
my faith and confession, and
whatever internally or externally I may be
or do. O God, preserve in me a devout
spirit, and hinder whatever might disturb
or hamper me. Receive me into the especial
care of Thy grace, and increase in
me the work that is now begun. Perfect
and complete it according to Thy power
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and grace to Thy glory and my salvation.
Keep me from evil thoughts, from idle
imaginations, from all uncleanliness, so that
in Thy fear I may begin a consecrated life
and continue therein. May the light of my
faith shine before men. May I give offense
to none, but rather in Christian conduct
edify the brethren and direct them to
all virtue.</p>
<p>Holy Jesus, do Thou unite with my body
and soul on this day. Nourish me with
Thy flesh and refresh me with Thy blood,
so that my weak faith be strengthened, and
receive the assurance of Thy grace, the remission
of my sin, and eternal salvation.
Invest me with the pure silk of Thy righteousness.
Clothe me in the true wedding
garment, that I may appear at Thy heavenly
board a worthy guest.</p>
<p>Now, Lord God and Father, be my help
and my protection! Lord Jesus Christ be
my bread, my light, and life! And Thou,
O Holy Ghost, illumine and preserve me
in the true sanctification, so that in that
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
estate, into which I again am permitted to
enter, I may remain for the course of my
life. Let me be enveloped in Thee. Without
Thee there is only grief. O dear
Savior, let me ever be with Thee. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer Before Holy Communion.</h3>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Eternal Son of God,
I am not worthy to open my lips and receive
the most precious sacrament of Thy
body and blood. For I am a sin-stained
man, but Thou art the Lord whom the
heavens can not encompass. How then can
a human being who is but dust and ashes
be worthy to receive Thy most holy body
and precious blood! I well know and acknowledge
that my sins are many and that
for that reason I am an unworthy guest at
Thy table. But I also sincerely believe
and confess it with my lips that by Thy
grace Thou canst render me worthy. For
Thou art omnipotent and gracious. Thou
only canst cleanse and make holy whatever
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
took rise in unclean seed. Thou canst
transform sinners into true and holy men,
when by Thy grace Thou forgivest sin and
renewest us with Thy Holy Spirit. Therefore
I pray Thee, by Thy power and love
grant me grace, that I may worthily approach
Thy altar, and not become guilty
of Thy body and blood by unworthy eating
and drinking, so that I may not receive
death in place of life. Grant me grace,
that I may know and test myself as a poor
sinner, my heart filled with sorrow over
mine iniquity, and may properly discern
Thy tender and noble body, and Thy holy,
precious blood. May my reason, senses,
and intellect be ever submissive to Thy
word, and may I be earnestly resolved to
better and improve my life with Thy help,
so that in this precious sacrament, I may
not only with my mouth receive Thy body
and blood, but also in true faith accept
Thee, my Savior and Redeemer, enthrone
Thee in my heart, and find in Thee my life
and blessedness. For Thou art the living
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
bread which cometh down from heaven and
bringeth life to men. Whoever cometh to
Thee shall nevermore hunger, and he that
believeth on Thee shall nevermore thirst.
Whoever eateth Thy flesh and drinketh
Thy blood dwelleth in Thee and Thou in
him, and shall never die. O beloved Lord,
my spirit and my mind yearn for Thee. As
the hart panteth after the water brooks, so
panteth my soul after Thee, O God. My
soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
when shall I come and appear before God?
Fill me with Thy grace. Amen.</p>

me with Thy body and blood, and like an
unclean child, after such purification, hast

grace and mercy, and put me pure, reproachless,

Father.</p>

in addition to such blessing, grant me Thy
grace through the workings of Thy Holy
Ghost, so that I may sufficiently understand
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
such blessing and grace, gratefully accept
it, and glorify and praise Thee with all my
heart. Grant me strength from above by
Thy Holy Spirit, that I may heartily forgive
my neighbor wherever he hath sinned
against me, even as Thou hast fully and
richly forgiven me my great and manifold
transgressions, yes, entirely blotted them
out and wilt never remember them. Help
me to love my neighbor and gladly show
him every good, as Thou hast done unto
me, and hast shown me more than I can

of the children of this world, that
I may not fall into hypocrisy as they do,
but today and always, in all my calling,
prove myself constant in godliness, so that
my life may decrease in vice and increase in
virtue. May I always faithfully serve Thee,

Thee, experience Thy grace and protection,
and eternally thank Thee, for Christ&rsquo;s sake.

<h3>Prayer for Faithful Teachers and Preachers.</h3>

<p>Merciful God, who hast commanded us

Thee for laborers in Thy harvest: I earnestly
beseech Thee, grant us, Thy sheep,
pastors according to Thy heart, to feed us

bishops, Christian pastors, pious teachers
over Thy congregation, faithfully to show
the true way to eternal life. Fill them
plenteously with Thy Holy Spirit, so that
they may fruitfully proclaim the holy and
precious word of the gospel, and sincerely
perfect Thy work. Grant them a courageous
heart, that without fear or favor they
may lift up their voices and put the adversaries
to silence. Open the door for their
word, that they may be blessed and go from
strength to strength. May they also be
shining examples for the flocks entrusted to
their care. Grant me and all listeners a
grateful heart, that we may communicate
in all good things unto them that teach us
the word, rejoice in them, forsake them not,
so that we may be blessed of Thee according
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
to Thy promise in all the works of our
hands. Preserve us from hirelings, time-servers,
unfaithful laborers, and hypocrites,
who falsely deceive the hearts of the righteous,
whom Thou hast never grieved, and
fortify the hands of the wicked, that they
will not turn from their evil ways. Let us
never be robbed of our faithful preachers
for the sake of our ingratitude, but rather
look upon the glory of Thy holy name, yea,
behold the Kingdom of Thine Anointed,
that it may prevail among us to the end of
the world. Amen.</p>

His righteousness: I pray Thee, grant us
grace, that Thy holy word may be preached

through a Christian conduct. Help us,
dear God, who are delivered from the
power of darkness and are translated into
the kingdom of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ,
in whom we have redemption through His
blood, even the forgiveness of sin, that we
may remain in His kingdom, faithfully continue
in the wholesome doctrine, and live
worthily as children of light in all piety
and godliness. And since the kingdom of
God cometh not with outward shew, neither
consists of mere words, but is power and
spirit: grant us grace, that we may be born
again from above through Thy saving word
and Thy Holy Spirit, co-heirs of life, so
that with our hearts we may dwell above
where Christ sitteth, and constantly seek
the inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
that fadeth not away. Enable us to be poor
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
in the spirit and humble, and such who
sorrow over their sins. Let us be anhungered
and athirst, and heartily yearn after
righteousness. May we ever be meek, and
suffer and overcome whatsoever of persecution
and tribulation may assail us, and revilings
and undeserved malignings with patience
and longsuffering. Keep us from all
offenses, whereby Thy holy name is blasphemed
and outraged, Thy kingdom hindered
and weakened. Grant us grace to practice
our faith in works of love and mercy,
feeding, clothing, harboring, visiting, comforting
the poor and distressed of this
world, so that when that great day dawns
we may hear the blessed and joyous voice
of Thy dear Son: Come ye blessed of My
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world.
Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer for Missions.</h3>
<p>I pray Thee, my heavenly Father,
through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, our
Lord, have mercy upon the unbelievers,
whoever and wherever they are, who still
walk in darkness, and do not yet possess
the light of Thy gospel. They are stricken
with blindness by the evil one. Their
foolish heart is darkened. They are alienated
from the life that is of Thee, through
their native ignorance, carried away to the
dumb idols, even as they are led, and in
their blindness curse and blaspheme Thy
dear Son, Jesus Christ, the mercy seat. For
that reason, O faithful God, take away the
veil, which is upon the heart of the Jews,
who stumble at the stone of stumbling and
the rock of offense. Illumine their eyes
that they may know the true Messiah, the
Savior of the world. Gather the heathen
and all unbelievers, who look upon Thy
word as foolishness, into the true fold and
the true assembly of Christians, the congregation
of saints, so that with us and all
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the faithful they may honor, glorify, and
worship Thee, the Father in the Son, and
the Son with the Father and the Holy
Ghost, ever one God and Lord. Open the
understanding of all men, who do not put
their salvation and their confidence solely
and alone on the true fundament and cornerstone,
even Jesus Christ, so that they
know Him, whom Thou hast sent, and in
the true faith and a sincere trust of their
hearts may acknowledge and accept Him
as their Savior and Redeemer, who through
His obedience and fulfillment of the law,
and through His bitter death, hath merited
an eternal salvation. We pray Thee also,
to return to the truth of Thy word all of
them who have defected from the Christian
faith, or err in sundry other things and are
cumbered with false doctrines. Thou God
of grace, have mercy upon those, who are
not of the true faith, who dwell in the
shadow of death, and in the darkness of
their minds walk on uneven paths. Seek
the lost, lead aright the erring, illumine the
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
blinded and infatuated, open the ears of
the deaf, unloose the tongues of the dumb,
who do not confess Thee, raise the fallen,
bring back the corrupt, assemble the dispersed,
lead aright the erring and seduced,
for Thy mercy&rsquo;s sake. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer Against False Doctrines and Sects.</h3>
<p>Gracious God! Thou hast warned us,
that we should beware of false prophets
who come in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly
are ravening wolves. And since in these
latter days, in which we now live, evil
times will come, in which Satan clothes himself
in the livery of heaven, and false teachers
and fraudulent laborers dissemble as
though they were the apostles of Christ,
who have the form of godliness but deny
the power thereof; and since the defection
from the pure doctrine, and the man of
sin, the son of perdition, who opposeth and
exalteth himself above all that is called
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
God shall be made manifest, help us, eternal
God, that we may be filled with the
love for truth, and avoid the spirit of lies
and all falsehoods and errors, abstain and
flee from all appearance of evil, so that we
may not be moved from the true faith, nor
yet beguiled from our reward, but may
continue steadfast by Thy word unto the
end. May we never be led astray, neither
through deceiving powers, signs, and miracles,
nor through any temptation to unrighteousness,
so that we be not tossed to
and fro, and carried about with every wind
of doctrine, by the slight of men, and cunning
craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive. Preserve Thy elect in this evil
world, O God, that they may not be led
into error. Shorten the days in these evil
times. Destroy the Antichrist, the wicked
child of perdition and temptation, through
the spirit of Thy mouth. Put an end to his
days through the appearance of Thy dear
Son. Preserve us also from unruly spirits
and schisms, from the ravenous wolves who
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
have no mercy for the flocks, from men who
speak perverse doctrines and draw the disciples
to themselves, from men of corrupt
minds who sow offense and bring about
separation, from the tares which the enemy
scatters, from thieves and murderers of the
soul. Let us only hear Thy voice, and follow
it from our hearts in true faith and
upright obedience, so that your word may
be our only rule and norm, according to
which we measure all doctrine, flee the evil
teaching, and all unrighteousness. Then
will we, too, have boldness and be not
brought to naught on that day when Jesus
Christ, our Savior, shall appear. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer Against the Enemies of Christendom.</h3>
<p>O Lord God, why do the wicked rage
without cause? and the mighty set themselves
and take counsel against Thee and
Thy Son, Thine Anointed? O Lord, how
numerous are Thine enemies, and great the
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
number of those who conspire against Thy
word to destroy it, and put their own evil
idolatry in its place and introduce false
doctrines into Thy Church. They invent
secret artifices and practices, to destroy the
confessors of Thy word. They counsel
what is evil, pregnant with calamity. They
lie in wait for us like the lion seeking his
prey. Thus they waylay our souls. They
open wide their jaws, like a gaping sepulchre,
to devour us. O Lord God, commit
us not to their will, for behold, the wicked
mob speaks in its heart, Thou, O Lord,
hast forgotten us. Thou hast concealed
Thy countenance. Arise, therefore, O
Lord. Lift up Thy hand, forget not the
distressed. Awaken, O Lord, why sleepest
Thou! Awake, and do not quite reject us.
Why dost Thou hide Thy face, and forget
our misery and distress? Arise, and help
us, and deliver us for Thy mercy sake, that
the enemy may not injure us, nor the children
of Belial harm us. Save us from the
hands of aliens, whose teaching is useless,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
and their works evil. For they will not be
guided to do good. They will not regard
Thee, the Lord of hosts, nor yet the works
of Thy hands. Thou wilt destroy and not
build them. O Lord God Sabaoth, militate
Thou against our assailants. Give victory
to our Christian government, and conquer
the enemies of Thy name. For victory
cometh from heaven, and is not
brought about by the great multitude.
Thou canst as readily help through the
few as through the many. Therefore destroy
the arm of the wicked. Make their
counsels of no account, that they can not
accomplish them, but must be brought to
naught with shame. They must return,
who hate Thee, and seek to annihilate Thy
holy word. They must be as chaff before
the wind. Thy holy angel brush them
aside, that they may not boast against Thee
and say our hand hath done this. Therefore
safeguard Thy honor among men, and
help us for Thy name&rsquo;s sake, that it may
not be desecrated and blasphemed. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer During War.</h3>
<p>O Lord God, who art righteous in Thy
judgment, and plenteous in mercy, whose
faithfulness endureth from generation to
generation, who rulest even above the din
of war: may all nations learn to know
that Thou alone art God, that Jesus Christ
is Thy Son, and that all who truly confess
Thy name are the people of Thy pasture
and the sheep of Thy hand. Thou hast permitted
the nations to rise up in war against
each other and our own beloved country
to become engulfed in its throes. O Lord
God, our Father, we know that war is a
punishment for sin and that we, too, have
justly merited Thy punishment through our
sins. Therefore we humbly confess our
sins, and supplicate Thy pity and compassion,
lay not our iniquities against us, but
graciously forgive us our sins and shortcomings
for the sake of our Lord Jesus
Christ. To Thy fatherly goodness and
care we commend our people, and especially
our soldiers and sailors now in the service
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
of their country. They are absent from
their loved ones, beset by dangers on all
sides. Be Thou ever near. Keep them
from all evil. O Thou, without whose
consent not even a sparrow falleth to the
ground and who hast numbered the very
hairs of our heads, take them under the
shadow of Thy wings. Give them courage
and obedience, fortitude and valor in the
hour of danger, and compassion and mercy
in the flush of victory. Prosper their arms
to the establishment of justice, peace, and
truth among all peoples. Lead them safely
back to their homes and their loved ones,
better citizens, better Christians than before.
And to Thy holy name be glory,
laud, and honor, world without end. Amen.</p>

we beseech Thine infinite mercy to bless
the officers and men of our army and navy.
Preserve them against all dangers and
temptations which may assail their lives.
Help them manfully to battle against and
overcome the powers of evil, the world, the
devil, and the flesh. May they ever be
filled with Thy Holy Spirit from on high,
and in courage, manliness, and truthfulness
prevail in the hour of danger and when
the battle rages. May they ever look to
Thee, who art the succorer of those in peril,
as to their only helper, and in Thy name
fight a holy fight to maintain the country&rsquo;s
honor and keep the flag unsullied, that
truth and righteousness may prevail. Put
to naught all evil designs and devices of
their enemies, both spiritual and temporal.
Guide Thou and direct them that they may
ever fight the good fight of faith and in the
end overcome and attain to their soul&rsquo;s salvation,
to the glory of Thy holy Name;
through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

who rulest and shapest all things to the
glory of Thy name and the betterment of
Thy people: we humbly beseech Thine infinite
mercy in this hour of our peril, judge
Thou between us and our enemies. Be
Thou our sure defense. Stir up Thy might
and hasten to our help. Lay not our sins
to our charge, but for the sake of Thy dear
Son, our only Lord and Savior, Jesus
Christ, manifest Thy mercy toward us and
blot out our iniquities, and sanctify and
guide us by Thy truth. We Thy poor servants
call upon Thy holy name, and implore
Thy grace. Have mercy upon us. Lead
us safely through the blood and carnage.
Make it appear that Thou art our deliverer.
Make us strong with the assurance
that it is Thy cause, that we are Thy children,
that Thou holdest our destiny in Thy
hand. And if it is Thy will that we should
lay down our lives&mdash;Thy will be done!

and with the hopeful assurance, that,
though kindred and friends be far away,

faintest sight of all who seek Thy succor.
If it be Thy pleasure, restore to them their
former health and vigor. Help them to

bear their pains without murmuring against
Thy grace. Give them patience and
strength and faith in Thee. May they rest
assured, that Thou wilt never leave nor forsake
them. Deliver them from the assaults
of the enemies of their souls. O God and
Father in heaven, bless them and all of us,
and may we ever seek those things that are
acceptable to Thy sight. Forgive us our
sins, not because of any merit or worthiness
in us, but solely because Thou art merciful
for Christ&rsquo;s sake. And to Thee, the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, be glory and honor
forever. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of a Patient.</h3>
<p>Lord God, Heavenly Father! Thou art
a faithful God, and wilt not suffer any one
to be tempted beyond what he is able, but
rather with the temptation wilt also make
a way to escape, that he may be able to
bear it. I supplicate Thee in my great suffering
and pain, so shape the cross, that it
may not lay too heavily upon me, and
strengthen me that I may bear it with patience,
and nevermore despair of Thy mercy.
O Christ, Thou Son of the living God!
Thou hast endured the agony of the cross
for me, and hast died for my sins, I beseech
Thee with my whole heart, have
mercy upon me a poor sinner, and forgive
me my transgressions, wherever I have
sinned against Thee. Let my faith in no
wise diminish. O God Holy Ghost! Thou
true comforter in all times of need. Keep
me ever in the spirit of patience and supplication.
Sanctify me in my reliance upon
Thee. Turn not from me in the hour of
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>

<h3>Prayer for a Blessed End.</h3>
<p>O Merciful God, Thou hast put a limit
to man&rsquo;s life, which no man can set aside.
For he has his definite time, the number of
his months rests with Thee. Thou hast
numbered all our days, which pass away
like a stream, as though we flew away.
Man is like grass, which soon withereth,
like the flower of the field, which passeth
away. Teach me, O merciful God, to know
and take to heart, that I, too, must pass
away and that my life has a limit, and I
must go hence. Behold, my days are as a
handbreadth before Thee, and my life as
nothing in Thy sight. Every man at his
best is altogether vanity. Lord, so teach us
to number our days, what it is, that we may
apply our hearts unto wisdom. Lord, teach
me to remember that I must die, and have
no continuing city in this pilgrimage. Make
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
known unto me my short and transient being,
that I may often think of my end, so
that in this world I may not live unto myself,
but live and die unto Thee, so that I
may bravely and joyously await the day of
my translation and the appearance of Thy
dear Son, Jesus Christ, and with a consecrated
life and a pious conduct hasten to
Him. Bless me, O God, with a blessed departure,
and when my hour cometh, that I
may joyously die, find a rational end in
true knowledge, and that my reason and
intellect be not deranged, and I speak no
arrogant words or blasphemies against
Thee, my Lord, or against my salvation.
Preserve me from an evil sudden death and
from eternal damnation. Let me not be
suddenly overcome by my last hour without
warning, but that I may prepare myself
with true repentance and sincere faith.
And when it comes make me joyous and
brave for my temporal death, which only
opens the door to the eternal life. May I
then, as Thy servant, depart in peace. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which
Thou hast prepared before the face of all
people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and
the glory of Thy people Israel. Grant
that my last word may be that which Thy
dear Son spoke on the cross, &ldquo;Father, into
Thy hands do I commend My spirit!&rdquo;
And when I can no longer speak, hear Thou
my last sigh through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer in the Hour of Death.</h3>
<p>Almighty, Everlasting, and Most Merciful
Lord and God! Thou art the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and I know that
Thou art willing and able to fulfill whatsoever
Thou hast said. Thou canst not lie.
Thy word is truth. Thou hast from the
beginning promised me Thy dear Son Jesus
Christ. And He is come, and has redeemed
me from the devil, death, hell, and sin.
And in Thy gracious providence Thou hast
for a greater surety established the sacraments
of Holy Baptism and Holy Communion
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
in which His true natural body
and blood are given me in, with, and under
the bread and wine, thus offering and assuring
me of the forgiveness of sins, eternal
life, and every heavenly gift. And because
of this Thy assurance I have made
use of these means of grace, and firmly relying
upon Thy word have received them.
And now I do not doubt but that I am secure
from the power of the devil, death,
hell, and sin. And if now my hour hath
come, and this is Thy divine will, I will
gladly and willingly depart hence and be
with Thee in peace. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer of the Bystanders for the Sick One.</h3>
<p>Almighty, Merciful God, who keepest

eyes of Thy mercy to this sick person,
strengthen him in body and soul, and forgive
him all his sins through Thy grace.
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Take the sacrifice of the innocent death of
Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, as a propitiation
for his transgressions, since he, too, is
baptized in His name, washed and cleansed
with His blood. Save him from the pains
and agonies of his body. Shorten his sufferings.
Keep him from the accusations of
his conscience and all temptations of the
enemy, so that in faith he may truly battle
and conquer. Grant him a blessed translation
to the eternal life. Send Thy holy
angels, that they accompany him to the
blessed company of all the elect in Christ
Jesus, our Lord. Amen.</p>

<h3>Prayer When the Patient Has Died in the Lord.</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ, Thou Lord of glory and

now and always, that Thou hast so mercifully
helped this now blessed one, and hast
taken his soul into Thy holy keeping. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
when the last day cometh Thou wouldest
reunite his soul with his body in heavenly
radiance, and grant us altogether, when the
divinely appointed hour cometh, to follow
him in blessedness. Meanwhile grant us a
Christian conduct, refresh all sorrowing
hearts with heavenly solace. Keep us in
Thy eternal grace, for the sake of Thy inexhaustible
mercy and goodness. Amen.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
